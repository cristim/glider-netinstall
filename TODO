TODO

-replace ISC-DHCPd and TFTPd with dnsmasq (provides same features and some more)
-replace Apache HTTPd with something tiny, like thttpd or others of his kind
-create entries in /etc/hosts out of the nodes' list (so they can be used by dnsmasq)
-support different distributions than the server's
-power on nodes before installation using wakeonlan
