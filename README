This is a simple netinstall configurator similar to cobbler, implemented using puppet.


You also need a site.pp file that should look something like this:

import "glider-netinstall"

node "glider.example.com"{

# Cobbler server configuration
#
# ip - an IP address on this machine accessible to the managed hosts
#
# Any of the subnet, netmask and gw fields can be arrays or single values.
# If there's an array, then we assume {subnet[i], netmask[i], gw[i], static_nodes_file[i]} 
# is a tuple that describes the config for a single subnet. Since the netmasks can be the 
# same on all the subnets, sometimes we don't really need this field to be an array too
#
# The dns field can be an array of DNS servers (unrelated to those above), or a single value

# static_nodes_file is a path to a file that contains "hostname IP MAC" tuples, one for each 
# managed node. You must create and maintain that file yourself
#
# os_mirror_base_url is the URL to the root of your closest CentOS mirror

cobbler_server{cobbler:
        ip => "192.168.56.101",
        subnet => "192.168.56.0",
        netmask => "255.255.255.0",     
        gw => "192.168.56.101",
        dns => "193.226.5.151",
        static_nodes_file => "/etc/puppet/manifests/nodes.list", 
	os_mirror_base_url => "ftp://ftp.roedu.net/pub/mirrors/centos.org", # only FTP works so far, since wget doesn't support wildcards in HTTP mode.
        root_password_hash =>'$1$7xtoAlN.$6ijtkhzu4JbGRBPIiB7zc0' # this will be set on the installed nodes
}
