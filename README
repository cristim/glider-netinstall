This is a simple netinstall configurator similar to cobbler, implemented using puppet.

It aims to be very easy to use and to integrate seamlessly with the puppet infrastructure 
that you may already use. Just see site.pp.example on how you should use it.

This software was written in 2010 by Cristian Măgherușan-Stanciu, as part of a MSc. thesis 
project at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

I hereby place all of it under the public domain, so feel free to use it for any purpose.

Still, I'd appreciate if you would give me any feedback, and patches are always welcome.

Thanks for using it, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
